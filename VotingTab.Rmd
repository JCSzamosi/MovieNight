Movie Night Voting Tabulation
=============================

## Executive Summaries Go At the Top For Engagement

* The survey was completed 16 times.
* We had four movies vying for top spot this week, with **RED**, Vampire 
Academy, Speed, and Super Mario Bros all pulling in a plurality of positive
votes.
* **RED** won with 10 votes in favour and 3 against
* The Grand Budapest Hotel achieved maximal apathy this week, with 11 neutral 
votes
* Neon Demon only received a single vote in favour, but Life Aquatic became our
standout loser with a score of -7 and a majority (9) of votes against.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
setwd('~/Personal/MovieNight')
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
devtools::load_all('~/MyProjects/AfterSl1p/')
theme_set(theme_bw())

cols = c('#878787','#FDDBC7','#B2182B')
ranklevs = c('I would NOT come to watch this film',
		  'I do not love this film but would still show up',
		  'I would REALLY LIKE to watch this film')
make_rank = function(x){
	x = factor(x, levels = ranklevs)
	x = as.numeric(x) -2
	return(x)
}
```

</details>

## Import and Clean Data

The voting data are available as a .csv file [here](./data/current_week.csv).

<details><summary>Click here for data wrangling code</summary>

```{r}
dat = read.csv('data/current_week.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = FALSE)
datm = as.matrix(dat)

tdf = read.csv('data/current_movies.csv', row.names = 1, header = FALSE, 
			   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
tdf = rbind('Timestamp',tdf)
titles = tdf[[1]]
names(titles) = c('Timestamp', rownames(tdf)[-1])

datm[datm %in% names(titles)] = titles[datm[datm %in% names(titles)]]

colnames(datm) = datm[1,]
datm = datm[-1,]

dat = (datm
	   %>% data.frame()
	   %>% mutate(Timestamp = substr(Timestamp, 1, 18),
	   		   Timestamp = ymd_hms(Timestamp)))
rev_titles = gsub(' [','',names(titles), fixed = TRUE)
rev_titles = gsub(']','',rev_titles, fixed = TRUE)
names(rev_titles) = titles
```

</details>


## Tabulate the results

```{r,  warning = FALSE, results = 'hold'}
dat_num = (dat
		   %>% select(-Timestamp)
		   %>% mutate_all(make_rank))
results = sort(colSums(dat_num), decreasing = TRUE)
res_df = data.frame(results)
#rownames(res_df) = rev_titles[rownames(res_df)]
res_df
```

#### RED Wins!

**RED** won with 7 points!
